This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning models. The dataset consists of transactional records labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. The data is preprocessed by removing unnecessary columns, encoding categorical variables like gender and transaction category, and extracting features such as hour, day, and month from timestamps. The dataset is then standardized to improve model performance. Multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier with different hyperparameters, are used to classify transactions. The models are trained and evaluated based on accuracy and confusion matrices. Due to file size limitations, the dataset cannot be uploaded directly, but it can be downloaded from Kaggle using the following links: Fraud Train Dataset and Fraud Test Dataset. This project aims to enhance financial security by identifying fraudulent activities effectively.
